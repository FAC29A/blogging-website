# SQL schema

Your project this week is to build a web app that stores data in a SQLite database.
## Spike 
Before you start writing features you need to design the schema for your data. Think about what different things your app needs to store, how they relate to each other, and how you can avoid duplicating information. Record your schema in your README.md using Markdown tables. Consider embedding a diagram to help visualise the relationships.
## Questions to consider 
What kinds of data relationships are there?
What’s a foreign key? How can they help us design schemas with relational data?

## User stories 
### Core 
As a user, I want to: submit information to your site for anyone to see
As a user, I want to: come back to your site later and see what I posted is still there
Since this project is open-ended you’ll need to write your own more specific user stories once you know what you want to build.
## Example project ideas 
Founders & Coders book sharing system
Food / coffee recommendations around Founders & Coders
Founders & Coders events calendar
## Acceptance Criteria 
[]A form for users to submit data
[]A page showing all the data
[]Semantic form elements with correctly associated labels
[]A SQLite database, deployed to fly.io as a persistent volume
[]A schema describing your database in your README
[]Tests for server routes and database access
[]Not process user input as SQL commands
[]Hidden environment variables (i.e. not on GitHub)
## Stretch criteria 
[]A way to view filtered/sorted data, instead of just all of it
[]GitHub Actions CI setup to run your tests when you push
